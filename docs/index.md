    Spatial-sequencing: The final frontier. These are the voyages of the pipeline, space-seek.<br>It's long term goals: to explore strange new tissues, to seek out new patterns within single-cellular life, to boldly map the transcriptome of cellsâ€” one space at a time.

## Overview

Welcome to space-seek's documentation! This guide is the main source of documentation for users that are getting started with the [long pipeline name](https://github.com/OpenOmics/space-seek/). 

The **`./space-seek`** pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: 

<section align="center" markdown="1" style="display: flex; flex-wrap: row wrap; justify-content: space-around;">

!!! inline custom-grid-button ""

    [<code style="font-size: 1em;">space-seek <b>run</b></code>](usage/run.md)   
    Run the space-seek pipeline with your input files.

!!! inline custom-grid-button ""

    [<code style="font-size: 1em;">space-seek <b>unlock</b></code>](usage/unlock.md)  
    Unlocks a previous runs output directory.

!!! inline custom-grid-button ""

    [<code style="font-size: 1em;">space-seek <b>install</b></code>](usage/install.md)  
    Download remote reference files locally.

    [<code style="font-size: 1em;">space-seek <b>cache</b></code>](usage/cache.md)  
    Cache remote software containers locally.

**space-seek** is an awesome spatial sequencing pipeline. It relies on technologies like [Singularity<sup>1</sup>](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by [Snakemake<sup>2</sup>](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster.

The pipeline is compatible with data generated from 10x Genomics Visium technologies. As input, it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.

Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the [usage](usage/run.md) section of each available sub command.
